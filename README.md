Tictactoe
===

Simple tic tac toe in Clojure, because I want to learn Clojure better

I actually detest tic-tac-toe. But it's the simplest game I know.

To run:


    `git clone git@github.com:jogjayr/ttt.git
    cd ttt
    lein run`
    
You play "x", the computer plays "o". It might fail or throw exceptions on invalid inputs, and quit.
